<div><strong>Discover the Cotton Cemí! A Journey through History, Science and Technology</strong></div>
<div>In front of you is an <strong>interactive totem</strong> lets you explore a very special object: the <strong>cotton cemí.</strong></div>
<div>
    But what is a <strong>cemí</strong>?</br>
    It's a sacred object used by some Indigenous peoples from the Caribbean islands. This one is made of <strong>cotton</strong> and is very rare. It has survived for centuries and traveled across the ocean to get here.

        <strong>An All-Italian Investigation</strong></br>
        In 2022, a group of Italian researchers started studying the cemí thanks to a project called <strong>E-RIHS</strong>. The work was done by the <strong>MAET – Museum of Anthropology and Ethnography</strong> at the University of Turin, together with scientists from the <strong>National Research Council (CNR)</strong>. The researchers didn't open or damage the cemí. Instead, they used <strong>special non-invasive techniques</strong> to explore both the outside and the inside of the object. Here are some of the cool methods they used:
    </span>
    <ul>
        <li>Photos taken in <strong>normal</strong>, <strong>infrared</strong>, and <strong>ultraviolet light</strong> to see hidden details.</li>
        <li>A kind of "X-ray" scan to look inside.</li>
        <li>Chemical tests to understand the <strong>materials</strong>, like the fibers and dyes.</li>
    </ul>
</diV>
<div>All this helped them create a very detailed <strong>3D digital model</strong> of the cemí — a perfect virtual copy of the real one!</div>
<div>
    <strong>Digital Cemí for Everyone</strong></br>
    In 2024, a second project called <strong>TAZEBAO</strong> began. It was led by MAET again, this time with a company called <strong>No Real Interactive</strong>.</br>
    The goal was to make a <strong>digital twin</strong> of the cemí — a version that people all around the world can explore and enjoy.

        How did they do it?</br>
        With the help of experts in <strong>3D design</strong>, <strong>technology</strong>, <strong>storytelling</strong>, and <strong>history</strong>, they created:
    </span>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>real-time 3D model</strong>, easy to use on computers, tablets, phones, and even in <strong>virtual reality</strong>.</li>
        <li><strong>Videos</strong>, <strong>images</strong>, and <strong>texts</strong> to tell the cemí's story.</li>
        <li>A <strong>phygital setup</strong> (physical and digital) that can be moved and shown in museums around the world.</li>
        <li>An exciting <strong>VR experience</strong> where you can follow the cemí's journey: from its discovery to Europe, and through all the scientific studies.</li>
    </ul>
