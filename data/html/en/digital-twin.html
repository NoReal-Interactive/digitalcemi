<div>This interactive totem hosts a high-definition virtual replica of the cotton cemí, including both its external and internal components. The model integrates data acquired during two separate investigation campaigns conducted at different times.</div>

    <span>In 2022, the E-RIHS project was launched by a team from the University of Turin affiliated with MAET - Museum of Anthropology and Ethnography, in collaboration with three departments of the Italian National Research Council (CNR). The team produced a photogrammetric model of the exterior and conducted internal investigations using various non-invasive techniques to generate accurate 3D models faithful to the original in both form and visual quality:</span>
	<ul>
		<li>Acquisition of photographic images in visible light, IRR (infrared reflectography), and UVL (ultraviolet-induced fluorescence);</li>
		<li>X-ray computed tomography combined with 3D laser surface scanning;</li>
		<li>Material characterization of the external surfaces using FTIR (Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy), UV-vis-NIR (ultraviolet-visible-near infrared spectroscopy), reflectance and fluorescence analysis, XRF (X-ray fluorescence), XR Flow energy, and Raman spectroscopy.</li>
    </ul>

    <span>In 2024, the TAZEBAO project began, carried out by the University of Turin (MAET - Museum of Anthropology and Ethnography) in collaboration with No Real Interactive srl. The goal was to create a "digital twin" of the cotton cemí, accessible to the public via kiosk stations, PCs, tablets, smartphones (via web browser), and VR headsets. The project included several workstreams:<span>
    <ul>
        <li>3D Modelling & Rendering: development of a real-time, web-based 3D model of the exterior, including polygon optimization, retopology, and re-meshing; texture work (multi-LOD atlas with generative AI upscaling); and implementation of web-based shaders (using ATON / three.js);</li>
        <li>Scientific and Narrative Content: creation of scientific texts, narratives, images, and video materials;</li>
        <li>Inclusive UX/UI Design: design and development of an inclusive user experience/interface to ensure ease of access for both general and specialized audiences;</li>
        <li>Phygital Exhibit Design: development of a portable and easily reconfigurable phygital scenography to accompany the physical display of the cotton cemí;</li>
        <li>Immersive VR Experience: design and implementation of an immersive virtual reality experience narrating the discovery of the cotton cemí, its journey to Europe, and subsequent exhibitions and scientific investigations.</li>
    </ul>
</div>
<div>The resulting digital twin provides the public with an informative, immersive, and engaging phygital experience to explore the story and structure of the cotton cemí.</div>
