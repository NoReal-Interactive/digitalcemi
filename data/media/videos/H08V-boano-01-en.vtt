00:00:00.266 --> 00:00:01.866
For a physical anthropologist

00:00:01.933 --> 00:00:05.666
the study of the body is a way to understand the human being

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.000
and the study of ancient bodies

00:00:08.300 --> 00:00:11.000
is a way to understand our evolutionary past

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:12.700
ancient human remains

00:00:12.766 --> 00:00:15.466
are in fact a biological archive of information

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:16.933
from which to draw

00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:19.700
insights into the lives of past populations

00:00:20.600 --> 00:00:23.866
it is an archive that contains no written documents

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:27.600
but signs left imprinted on bones and the body

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:29.333
that can be read

00:00:29.866 --> 00:00:31.100
through the language

00:00:31.666 --> 00:00:32.466
of biology

00:00:32.966 --> 00:00:33.766
and that can

00:00:34.166 --> 00:00:36.166
allow us to reconstruct

00:00:36.566 --> 00:00:39.400
stories that may be individual

00:00:39.900 --> 00:00:41.200
or collective stories

00:00:41.566 --> 00:00:44.333
that together narrate our past

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:48.200
in this view of the anthropological archive

00:00:48.533 --> 00:00:51.300
the cemí in the Museum of Anthropology and Ethnography

00:00:51.766 --> 00:00:53.666
is a paradigmatic example

00:00:54.366 --> 00:00:56.466
because it represents the meeting point

00:00:56.700 --> 00:00:58.766
between biology and culture

00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:00.766
a human skull

00:01:01.266 --> 00:01:03.533
integrated into an artifact

00:01:04.133 --> 00:01:05.533
allows us to understand

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:07.866
not only the biology of the individual

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:09.766
to whom that skull once belonged

00:01:10.166 --> 00:01:12.200
but also the culture of the people

00:01:12.533 --> 00:01:14.333
who created the artifact
