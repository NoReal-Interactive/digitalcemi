00:00:00,333 --> 00:00:02,866
The taíno societies were very elaborate

00:00:03,333 --> 00:00:04,900
it is necessary to overcome the image

00:00:05,133 --> 00:00:06,400
conveyed from the beginning

00:00:06,700 --> 00:00:08,366
of the Spanish conquest

00:00:08,666 --> 00:00:11,133
of a "primitive" population

00:00:11,466 --> 00:00:13,333
on the contrary, they were very organized societies

00:00:13,600 --> 00:00:14,466
with tribal chiefs

00:00:14,900 --> 00:00:16,733
political leaders called cacique

00:00:16,933 --> 00:00:17,733
and cacica in Taíno

00:00:18,200 --> 00:00:19,200
the island of Hispaniola

00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:20,366
now divided

00:00:20,366 --> 00:00:22,200
between the Dominican Republic and Haiti

00:00:22,366 --> 00:00:24,700
basically comprised five kingdoms

00:00:24,766 --> 00:00:26,100
we can say that each

00:00:26,466 --> 00:00:29,100
was led by a cacique, a very important figure

00:00:29,500 --> 00:00:31,933
respected by the taíno people
