00:00:00.533 --> 00:00:05.533
In 1927, the lawyer Cesare Buscaglia from Genoa

00:00:05.733 --> 00:00:06.600
wrote a letter

00:00:07.133 --> 00:00:08.900
to Ernesto Schiaparelli

00:00:09.133 --> 00:00:12.466
who at the time was director of the Museum of Antiquities in Turin

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:14.366
offering as a gift

00:00:14.766 --> 00:00:15.866
two important

00:00:16.300 --> 00:00:19.766
antiquities from the island of Santo Domingo

00:00:20.733 --> 00:00:23.266
Schiaparelli in turn wrote

00:00:23.766 --> 00:00:26.300
to the Minister of Public Education

00:00:26.600 --> 00:00:29.366
Pietro Fedele, requesting authorization

00:00:29.700 --> 00:00:32.133
to acquire these two objects

00:00:32.766 --> 00:00:34.966
authorization which the minister granted

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:37.666
in a letter addressed to Schiaparelli

00:00:37.933 --> 00:00:39.266
which arrived

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:41.366
just a few days before his death

00:00:41.533 --> 00:00:45.700
which occurred on February 14, 1928

00:00:46.533 --> 00:00:47.333
At that point

00:00:47.933 --> 00:00:50.266
the objects arrived in Turin

00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:51.733
and were acquired

00:00:51.900 --> 00:00:53.000
by the Museum of

00:00:53.166 --> 00:00:55.600
Anthropology and Ethnography of the University

00:00:56.366 --> 00:00:58.166
directed by Giovanni Marro

00:00:58.600 --> 00:00:59.800
who exhibited them

00:01:00.466 --> 00:01:02.933
at the museum's original location in Palazzo Carignano

00:01:03.666 --> 00:01:05.900
and later also at the next location

00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:09.100
in the former San Giovanni Battista Hospital

00:01:09.733 --> 00:01:13.066
as part of a scenographic display built with a

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:14.966
small Peruvian temple

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:17.933
without realizing the

00:01:18.566 --> 00:01:20.100
origin and the

00:01:20.366 --> 00:01:23.500
extraordinary significance of these two objects
