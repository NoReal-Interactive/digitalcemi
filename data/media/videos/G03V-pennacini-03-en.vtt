00:00:00.366 --> 00:00:01.766
The Cambiaso family

00:00:02.200 --> 00:00:03.100
had maintained

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:05.933
close ties with Genoa

00:00:06.133 --> 00:00:07.900
their city of origin

00:00:08.100 --> 00:00:10.200
Giovanni Battista and his brother Luigi

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:12.766
returned several times

00:00:13.366 --> 00:00:16.000
to Genoa, and on one of these occasions

00:00:16.566 --> 00:00:19.900
they brought with them and donated to the mayor

00:00:20.566 --> 00:00:21.933
a small vial

00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:24.366
containing a portion

00:00:25.100 --> 00:00:28.100
of what was believed to be

00:00:28.566 --> 00:00:31.000
the ashes of Christopher Columbus

00:00:31.366 --> 00:00:34.166
found in the cathedral of Santo Domingo

00:00:35.333 --> 00:00:38.133
in a lecture the Cambiaso brothers

00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:41.933
gave at the local Historical Society

00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:45.966
they suggested to the mayor of Genoa

00:00:46.166 --> 00:00:47.966
that the city should organize

00:00:48.700 --> 00:00:51.700
the celebrations for the fourth centenary

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:53.566
of the discovery of America

00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:56.600
and in fact, in 1892

00:00:57.533 --> 00:00:59.100
Genoa would celebrate

00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:03.566
with a large Italo-American exposition

00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:06.466
the discovery of America

00:01:06.866 --> 00:01:09.400
we can assume that the Cambiaso family

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:11.500
intended to exhibit

00:01:11.866 --> 00:01:15.100
the two cemíes in Genoa on that occasion

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:16.400
but we have

00:01:16.866 --> 00:01:19.800
no documentation to support this hypothesis
