00:00:00.033 --> 00:00:05.266
The Spaniards quickly realized in Hispaniola

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.366
that in order to keep things moving forward

00:00:08.366 --> 00:00:10.233
especially to obtain food

00:00:10.233 --> 00:00:13.333
that is, to be able to

00:00:13.600 --> 00:00:14.866
stockpile supplies

00:00:14.866 --> 00:00:16.466
I don’t know the English word right now

00:00:16.466 --> 00:00:17.266
to generate

00:00:17.700 --> 00:00:19.366
food reserves

00:00:19.366 --> 00:00:21.433
they depended entirely

00:00:21.433 --> 00:00:23.333
on the indigenous population

00:00:23.700 --> 00:00:25.000
and since the caciques

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.866
among other things, had the duty of

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:32.233
giving orders

00:00:32.233 --> 00:00:35.900
for the execution of specific tasks related to agriculture

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:36.700
fishing

00:00:37.466 --> 00:00:39.500
harvesting, cutting wood

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:41.966
house construction, it was all under

00:00:41.966 --> 00:00:43.500
their control

00:00:43.833 --> 00:00:44.300
and of course

00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:46.533
the nobles were the ones who ensured

00:00:46.566 --> 00:00:47.933
in different areas

00:00:47.966 --> 00:00:51.666
that these commands were carried out

00:00:51.833 --> 00:00:55.500
this is why the nobles (nitaino) were described as cosmographers

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:56.700
or geographers
