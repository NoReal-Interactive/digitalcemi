00:00:00.566 --> 00:00:04.533
The cotton cemí is an extraordinary work

00:00:05.333 --> 00:00:06.900
for several reasons

00:00:07.666 --> 00:00:09.866
it is from a historical point of view

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:13.666
as it is a witness to the Conquest

00:00:14.466 --> 00:00:15.666
thus of the first

00:00:16.166 --> 00:00:18.966
encounter and clash between Europeans

00:00:19.666 --> 00:00:21.600
and the ancient peoples

00:00:22.466 --> 00:00:23.266
of the Americas

00:00:23.366 --> 00:00:24.933
in particular the Caribbean

00:00:25.166 --> 00:00:27.900
which shortly thereafter would succumb

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:30.933
to violence and exploitation

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:35.333
but it is also a fundamental artifact

00:00:35.933 --> 00:00:39.466
from a cultural and aesthetic perspective

00:00:40.133 --> 00:00:42.200
since the techniques

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:45.766
and styles with which it was made

00:00:46.533 --> 00:00:48.500
speak to us of a universe

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:51.000
of values, of meanings

00:00:51.933 --> 00:00:55.866
that define these very ancient civilizations

00:00:56.666 --> 00:00:58.400
and finally, it is

00:00:58.900 --> 00:01:00.533
an extraordinary object

00:01:00.933 --> 00:01:02.733
also from a spiritual perspective

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:05.533
we might define it as a person-object

00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:08.166
since it contains within it

00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:12.266
the skull or part of the skull of a human being

00:01:12.933 --> 00:01:13.933
a chief

00:01:14.866 --> 00:01:19.266
who, in the Taíno worldview

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:21.066
continued to communicate

00:01:21.566 --> 00:01:24.200
with his people even after death

00:01:24.766 --> 00:01:28.200
and is therefore imbued with a spiritual essence

00:01:28.566 --> 00:01:32.100
that, in a way, continues to live within it
