00:00:00.233 --> 00:00:02.100
An object

00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:04.966
of interest is obviously

00:00:05.666 --> 00:00:07.200
I don't want to call it an idol

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:08.300
but a figure

00:00:08.833 --> 00:00:12.800
that was recovered from the south of the Dominican Republic

00:00:13.566 --> 00:00:18.533
in a cave in what is now the Azua region

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:21.600
we don't know exactly where

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:24.866
but what is important is that

00:00:25.433 --> 00:00:28.800
studies and analysis of this object

00:00:28.900 --> 00:00:31.533
which is the figure of a person

00:00:31.666 --> 00:00:33.000
of an individual

00:00:33.866 --> 00:00:37.200
made of cotton and a variety of other materials

00:00:37.266 --> 00:00:39.966
including, inside

00:00:39.966 --> 00:00:45.566
what we think is wood to hold the piece together

00:00:46.033 --> 00:00:46.833
but

00:00:47.433 --> 00:00:50.366
what I find really interesting is that

00:00:50.366 --> 00:00:55.533
this particular object refers to a deceased individual

00:00:55.633 --> 00:00:59.366
and part of it is that it encapsulates in the head

00:00:59.466 --> 00:01:01.766
the front side of the skull

00:01:02.833 --> 00:01:05.000
we return to the term guaíza

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:08.666
where your soul resides is in your face

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:11.600
this is what makes you a living person

00:01:12.033 --> 00:01:12.866
obviously

00:01:12.866 --> 00:01:16.700
this is not a living person, it is a deceased individual

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:20.466
but of all the things they could choose

00:01:21.066 --> 00:01:22.500
to include

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:25.366
within the idol, they chose the face

00:01:25.666 --> 00:01:29.033
everything else is reconstructed

00:01:29.033 --> 00:01:31.566
and this is usually what happens in many societies

00:01:31.566 --> 00:01:35.066
when someone dies your status changes

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.233
you are disassembled

00:01:39.233 --> 00:01:40.633
they have to take the skull

00:01:40.633 --> 00:01:42.100
and they have to take the bones

00:01:42.466 --> 00:01:43.966
long bones and so on

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:46.900
and then reconstitute the body

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:51.366
so the deceased ancestor is given a new body

00:01:51.366 --> 00:01:53.900
and thus a new status and a new role

00:01:55.166 --> 00:01:58.633
and this thing of disassembling the chief's body

00:01:58.633 --> 00:02:00.333
and reassembling it

00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:02.966
is an interesting theme that we encounter

00:02:02.966 --> 00:02:06.666
even in Puerto Rico in some archaeological sites

00:02:07.666 --> 00:02:11.666
where the individual who dies is

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:15.766
essentially placed in secondary burials

00:02:16.166 --> 00:02:18.566
so part of the body is in a cave

00:02:18.566 --> 00:02:20.900
part of the body is kept in a basket

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:23.300
part of the body is in another cave

00:02:23.366 --> 00:02:28.333
and you begin to understand how dying and being divided

00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:30.800
this brings together all the caves

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:33.933
and the Taíno believe they came from a cave

00:02:34.366 --> 00:02:35.800
so it tells you where

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:37.566
this particular ancestor

00:02:37.566 --> 00:02:41.333
has claims on particular points of the landscape

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:44.066
that are part of the geography

00:02:44.633 --> 00:02:47.266
of this person

00:02:47.266 --> 00:02:48.066
of his territory

00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:54.533
so I think the cotton cemí is unique in its kind

00:02:54.766 --> 00:02:57.300
we haven't found anything like it

00:02:57.300 --> 00:02:59.500
anywhere in the Caribbean

00:02:59.633 --> 00:03:01.800
mainly due to preservation issues

00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:04.700
so it is

00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:07.333
really central to understanding

00:03:07.633 --> 00:03:10.400
the living and the dead and their relationships

00:03:11.266 --> 00:03:14.866
and how this was expressed through material culture
