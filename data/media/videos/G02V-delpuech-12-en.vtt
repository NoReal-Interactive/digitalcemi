00:00:00.333 --> 00:00:01.900
Many Taíno archaeological objects

00:00:02.200 --> 00:00:04.900
have been discovered in cavities

00:00:04.933 --> 00:00:05.733
in caves

00:00:05.733 --> 00:00:07.566
especially in the Greater Antilles

00:00:07.666 --> 00:00:08.466
in Cuba

00:00:08.666 --> 00:00:11.200
in Hispaniola or Puerto Rico

00:00:11.333 --> 00:00:12.800
where there are underground cavities

00:00:13.066 --> 00:00:14.000
sometimes very large

00:00:14.533 --> 00:00:15.966
in these caves we often find

00:00:16.266 --> 00:00:17.700
rock paintings as well

00:00:18.166 --> 00:00:20.100
regarding the objects found in these caves

00:00:20.200 --> 00:00:21.300
we have two hypotheses

00:00:21.366 --> 00:00:23.166
which are also compatible

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:24.200
on the one hand

00:00:24.466 --> 00:00:25.333
the possibility and perhaps

00:00:25.333 --> 00:00:27.366
the certainty that in these cavities

00:00:27.566 --> 00:00:29.566
a number of religious rites took place

00:00:29.866 --> 00:00:31.266
ceremonies or other events

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:33.133
and therefore the objects found there

00:00:33.266 --> 00:00:34.666
like the cotton cemí

00:00:34.933 --> 00:00:35.533
could

00:00:35.533 --> 00:00:37.200
be part of what could be considered

00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:39.166
a sanctuary inside a cave

00:00:39.933 --> 00:00:41.700
and that is how these objects

00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:43.500
could have been preserved

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:47.166
the other possibility

00:00:47.733 --> 00:00:49.566
is that at the time of the Spanish conquest

00:00:50.133 --> 00:00:50.766
all these objects

00:00:50.766 --> 00:00:52.066
that we now observe as

00:00:52.133 --> 00:00:53.933
masterpieces of the art of these societies

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:56.166
were considered

00:00:56.166 --> 00:00:58.066
especially by Christians

00:00:58.400 --> 00:01:00.600
as diabolical objects to be destroyed

00:01:00.766 --> 00:01:01.400
we know for example

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:03.500
that many of these cotton dolls were destroyed

00:01:03.700 --> 00:01:05.800
because they contained human skulls

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:07.300
they were considered symbols of evil

00:01:08.133 --> 00:01:10.300
and we can think that the Taíno

00:01:10.566 --> 00:01:12.000
at the time of the conquest

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:13.766
would have hidden in these cavities

00:01:13.933 --> 00:01:15.333
the objects they worshipped

00:01:15.333 --> 00:01:16.733
so that they would escape destruction

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:19.300
perhaps we will never know exactly what happened

00:01:19.533 --> 00:01:21.700
whether the cotton cemí was in its sanctuary

00:01:21.866 --> 00:01:22.866
or was hidden

00:01:22.966 --> 00:01:25.800
to escape destruction

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:28.000
but certainly by miracle it has come down to us
