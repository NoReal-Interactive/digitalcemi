00:00:01.100 --> 00:00:02.700
The most important archaeological finds

00:00:03.200 --> 00:00:05.733
of the Taino culture

00:00:06.366 --> 00:00:08.100
come from the island of Hispaniola and specifically

00:00:08.100 --> 00:00:11.000
from the part that is now the Dominican Republic

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:14.500
but they are made of wood or ceramics

00:00:14.500 --> 00:00:19.900
the only one made of cotton with a secondary burial

00:00:19.900 --> 00:00:21.000
is the one in Turin

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:22.000
and hence its importance

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:23.733
because there were references to this

00:00:23.733 --> 00:00:26.000
but I had never seen a specimen before
