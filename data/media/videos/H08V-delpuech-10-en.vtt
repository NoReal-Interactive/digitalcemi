00:00:00.666 --> 00:00:02.966
Like the cotton cemí of Turin

00:00:03.066 --> 00:00:04.600
which encloses a skull

00:00:04.666 --> 00:00:05.566
inside it

00:00:06.133 --> 00:00:08.966
which is the skull of a high-ranking character

00:00:09.366 --> 00:00:12.200
who was to be venerated as an ancestor

00:00:12.533 --> 00:00:13.800
we observe among the Taíno

00:00:14.066 --> 00:00:14.866
different ways

00:00:14.933 --> 00:00:16.600
of preserving the remains

00:00:16.900 --> 00:00:18.066
of the deceased

00:00:18.333 --> 00:00:20.300
there are those called funeral urns

00:00:20.566 --> 00:00:22.200
some are preserved

00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:23.900
in hollowed-out tree trunks

00:00:23.966 --> 00:00:26.066
often very worked and in which the bones were preserved

00:00:26.333 --> 00:00:27.466
It is also known that in some cases

00:00:27.966 --> 00:00:29.600
these bones were kept in baskets

00:00:29.700 --> 00:00:30.500
inside the houses

00:00:30.966 --> 00:00:31.966
which may have confused

00:00:32.266 --> 00:00:33.766
the Spaniards

00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:35.800
who sometimes believed they were signs of

00:00:36.066 --> 00:00:36.866
cannibalism

00:00:36.900 --> 00:00:38.333
while they were the bones

00:00:38.766 --> 00:00:40.600
of ancestors

00:00:40.966 --> 00:00:41.766
of the group

00:00:41.966 --> 00:00:44.466
we find the same thing in archaeological remains

00:00:44.533 --> 00:00:45.866
in the excavations

00:00:46.166 --> 00:00:47.733
sometimes we find human remains

00:00:47.866 --> 00:00:49.366
in primary position

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:51.733
that is often buried

00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:53.933
in a crouched position on the side

00:00:54.533 --> 00:00:55.333
but we often observe

00:00:55.366 --> 00:00:56.900
phenomena that we define

00:00:56.966 --> 00:00:58.300
secondary burials

00:00:58.300 --> 00:00:59.600
that appear throughout the Amazon area

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:02.166
in this case we have

00:01:02.166 --> 00:01:03.666
a first burial

00:01:03.700 --> 00:01:04.733
in which the dead are not covered with earth

00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:06.500
keeping them inside the house or elsewhere

00:01:06.966 --> 00:01:08.533
and later even after a long time

00:01:08.666 --> 00:01:10.966
rituals were practiced

00:01:11.133 --> 00:01:12.766
in which the skulls were recovered

00:01:12.866 --> 00:01:14.200
for this reason archaeologists

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:15.533
sometimes found isolated skulls

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:17.266
and we can imagine that

00:01:17.466 --> 00:01:18.300
other cotton cemí

00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:20.000
mentioned in the sources

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:21.166
whose presence is often reported

00:01:21.566 --> 00:01:22.866
probably existed

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:25.000
but have disappeared and at best

00:01:25.066 --> 00:01:26.366
in archaeological remains

00:01:26.466 --> 00:01:28.100
we find isolated skulls but we cannot

00:01:28.366 --> 00:01:29.366
obviously interpret them

00:01:29.766 --> 00:01:31.000
as if they had been

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:32.333
inside

00:01:32.366 --> 00:01:33.166
this type of figure

00:01:33.366 --> 00:01:36.500
in cotton
