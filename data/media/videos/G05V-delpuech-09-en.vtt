00:00:02.566 --> 00:00:03.366
For a long time

00:00:03.966 --> 00:00:05.933
people spoke

00:00:06.400 --> 00:00:07.966
of the disappearance of the Taíno

00:00:08.100 --> 00:00:10.133
wiped out by colonization

00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:12.400
by genocide and disease

00:00:12.800 --> 00:00:16.133
recent genetic studies

00:00:16.466 --> 00:00:18.200
have shown that this was not the case

00:00:18.366 --> 00:00:19.766
to the extent that

00:00:20.066 --> 00:00:21.533
especially at the beginning of the conquest

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:22.966
only men disembarked

00:00:23.066 --> 00:00:23.866
warriors

00:00:23.966 --> 00:00:25.266
Spanish soldiers

00:00:25.533 --> 00:00:26.566
and so some had children

00:00:26.600 --> 00:00:28.500
with Indigenous women

00:00:28.866 --> 00:00:30.500
today we observe

00:00:30.933 --> 00:00:33.100
especially in Puerto Rico and other islands

00:00:33.333 --> 00:00:35.766
a reclaiming of Taíno identity

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:38.933
seeking to reconnect with this Amerindian past

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:41.966
and with the first inhabitants of the Antilles

00:00:41.966 --> 00:00:43.366
we are witnessing movements

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:44.933
that can be described as neo-Taíno

00:00:45.466 --> 00:00:48.100
in which people who have lost continuity

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:49.600
of language

00:00:49.900 --> 00:00:51.266
of rituals and religion

00:00:51.566 --> 00:00:53.766
are reclaiming all of this

00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:55.900
by studying archaeology itself

00:00:56.066 --> 00:00:56.900
studying

00:00:56.933 --> 00:00:58.700
what might have been written by chroniclers

00:00:58.800 --> 00:00:59.966
especially Spanish chroniclers

00:01:00.266 --> 00:01:01.933
and it can take a political turn

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:03.200
as in Puerto Rico

00:01:03.466 --> 00:01:04.700
where some independence activists

00:01:04.866 --> 00:01:07.366
seek to separate from the United States

00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:08.533
and want

00:01:08.533 --> 00:01:10.666
their island to reclaim its Taíno name

00:01:10.900 --> 00:01:12.533
the one it originally had

00:01:12.666 --> 00:01:13.600
namely Borinken

00:01:13.933 --> 00:01:16.200
we witnessed a similar phenomenon

00:01:16.900 --> 00:01:18.700
in the former French Santo Domingo

00:01:18.733 --> 00:01:21.466
on the western side of Hispaniola

00:01:21.866 --> 00:01:22.800
when

00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:24.366
the leader of the rebel slaves

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:26.100
who defeated the Napoleonic armies

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:27.566
proclaimed independence

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:28.800
on January 1st

00:01:28.933 --> 00:01:30.333
of the year 1804

00:01:30.533 --> 00:01:31.666
and decided to give

00:01:31.900 --> 00:01:34.066
the name Haiti to this new country

00:01:34.333 --> 00:01:35.966
which was the Taíno name of the island

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:37.733
meaning "the land of high mountains"
