00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:04.633
The Spaniards were very quick to realize that

00:00:04.633 --> 00:00:06.333
to control the caciques

00:00:06.633 --> 00:00:11.333
they had to destroy their system of government

00:00:11.366 --> 00:00:14.500
and their system of government was centered on

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:16.666
the cohoba ritual

00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:20.466
because all the important decisions that the caciques

00:00:20.600 --> 00:00:23.100
made

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:26.200
together with their assistants, the nitainos

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.166
were based on cohoba

00:00:32.033 --> 00:00:35.066
as a ceremony but also as a substance

00:00:35.066 --> 00:00:36.000
cohoba

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.166
is a South American plant

00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:40.866
that was introduced to the Caribbean islands

00:00:41.066 --> 00:00:44.033
and is still used today by many ethnic societies

00:00:44.033 --> 00:00:45.666
more or less for the same reasons

00:00:45.833 --> 00:00:50.000
to be able to transcend oneself and communicate with

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:51.966
other spheres of the universe

00:00:52.166 --> 00:00:57.266
and cohoba is a seed

00:00:58.566 --> 00:01:03.033
that grows in a pod, from a tree

00:01:03.033 --> 00:01:04.466
at certain times of the year

00:01:04.466 --> 00:01:05.633
it falls

00:01:05.633 --> 00:01:09.400
these pods fall, and they are collected

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:11.966
and these seeds are then dried

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:15.900
and this is where the ceremonial pestles come into play

00:01:16.466 --> 00:01:20.400
these ceremonial pestles feature characters

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:22.733
or figures that are imbued with cemí

00:01:23.966 --> 00:01:25.633
with their power

00:01:25.633 --> 00:01:28.100
they transform a seed

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:31.700
into this powdery substance

00:01:31.966 --> 00:01:33.533
which is then inhaled

00:01:33.766 --> 00:01:36.400
the inhalers, some of them truly beautiful

00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:37.633
from the Dominican Republic

00:01:37.633 --> 00:01:38.533
for example

00:01:39.066 --> 00:01:42.566
are also, let’s say, figurines

00:01:42.566 --> 00:01:45.600
statues because they are bifurcated

00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:49.833
but where the two forks join

00:01:49.833 --> 00:01:52.366
there is usually a figure

00:01:55.066 --> 00:01:57.933
very often, it is through the figure's anus

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:01.900
that one blows

00:02:02.466 --> 00:02:05.700
so it’s the reverse of normal physiology

00:02:05.900 --> 00:02:07.566
so someone blows into it

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:10.666
sorry for explaining it in reverse

00:02:12.866 --> 00:02:15.966
the anus is where the single tube enters

00:02:15.966 --> 00:02:19.300
which goes into the dish where the cohoba is placed

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:22.233
the other two tubes go into the nostrils

00:02:22.233 --> 00:02:25.200
and through the anus, the substance is absorbed

00:02:25.366 --> 00:02:28.033
so to be magical

00:02:28.033 --> 00:02:31.866
it must pass through the potential of the figure

00:02:31.866 --> 00:02:34.400
of these characters imbued with cemí

00:02:34.433 --> 00:02:36.266
which naturally makes them agents

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:39.500
they are the cause of this effect

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:41.433
of the hallucinogenic drug

00:02:41.433 --> 00:02:45.566
which ultimately allowed them to converse

00:02:46.033 --> 00:02:46.933
discuss

00:02:47.466 --> 00:02:49.100
convince

00:02:50.233 --> 00:02:50.900
the cemí

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:54.800
about policies and decisions to be made

00:02:54.866 --> 00:02:55.900
to be executed

00:02:56.500 --> 00:03:00.800
so cohoba is truly one of many

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:02.500
I mean, South America is full

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:04.366
it is one of the hotspots for

00:03:04.433 --> 00:03:08.166
hallucinogens and drugs

00:03:08.166 --> 00:03:12.166
but this one is particularly significant

00:03:12.166 --> 00:03:13.566
in the Caribbean

00:03:13.766 --> 00:03:16.366
there were a few others that also created

00:03:17.100 --> 00:03:20.466
altered mental states, but our botanical evidence is

00:03:20.466 --> 00:03:23.166
the archaeobotanical evidence is still very limited
