00:00:00.033 --> 00:00:04.800
The Taíno society, most

00:00:05.166 --> 00:00:06.400
of the historical documents

00:00:06.400 --> 00:00:09.366
agree that it was stratified

00:00:09.366 --> 00:00:12.966
there were three essential categories

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:16.433
that the Taíno society

00:00:16.433 --> 00:00:20.333
recognized as different statuses

00:00:20.566 --> 00:00:22.266
one of which is cacique

00:00:23.066 --> 00:00:24.100
which can be

00:00:24.100 --> 00:00:27.300
translated as chief or jefe in Spanish

00:00:27.966 --> 00:00:30.000
the other is nitaíno

00:00:30.166 --> 00:00:32.566
and you can recognize as a Taíno term

00:00:32.566 --> 00:00:34.300
that indicates 'the good ones'

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:37.633
it connects to this idea of a particular status

00:00:37.633 --> 00:00:39.266
that was higher

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:42.566
than the common people

00:00:43.566 --> 00:00:46.866
the 'people' had a term

00:00:46.866 --> 00:00:48.200
widely used

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:50.966
throughout the documentation we have

00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:56.800
and it is that of naboría or naboria

00:00:56.800 --> 00:01:00.266
and linguistically it means 'the rest of them'

00:01:01.166 --> 00:01:02.733
'all the others'

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:05.333
so you can see that there was a ruling class

00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:07.600
there was a class that was elite

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:10.433
perhaps they were and this is my interpretation

00:01:10.433 --> 00:01:12.166
that they were

00:01:12.633 --> 00:01:14.666
related to the lineage of a cacique

00:01:14.666 --> 00:01:16.333
they could be very collateral

00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:18.900
not directly so close

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:23.366
but they were the main advisors that form the government

00:01:23.366 --> 00:01:25.966
with the cacique at the head

00:01:28.033 --> 00:01:28.833
of all

00:01:29.266 --> 00:01:30.966
so essentially

00:01:30.966 --> 00:01:32.066
the categories

00:01:32.066 --> 00:01:34.200
there were two exceptions that we have identified

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:38.466
or special statuses: one was the shaman

00:01:39.033 --> 00:01:43.266
which in Taíno terms is behike or boytío

00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:46.333
there are different spellings of this

00:01:47.133 --> 00:01:48.466
who were obviously

00:01:48.466 --> 00:01:50.200
medicine doctors

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:51.366
in the sense that

00:01:51.366 --> 00:01:55.000
they were in charge of restoring health

00:01:55.033 --> 00:01:57.566
and the well-being of the individuals

00:01:58.233 --> 00:02:00.833
on the other hand, the cacique could also do it

00:02:00.833 --> 00:02:05.466
but in terms of the well-being of the entire population

00:02:06.966 --> 00:02:09.466
so there are very defined categories

00:02:09.466 --> 00:02:11.800
and it seems that in the Dominican Republic

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:14.966
what we call Hispaniola: Haiti and the Dominican Republic

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:19.466
the hierarchy was much more pronounced

00:02:19.466 --> 00:02:23.933
compared to Cuba or perhaps Puerto Rico

00:02:24.966 --> 00:02:26.266
so it is

00:02:26.266 --> 00:02:27.066
I think that

00:02:27.066 --> 00:02:29.400
the essential categorization

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:32.100
the way the Taíno society was structured

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:33.166
and composed
