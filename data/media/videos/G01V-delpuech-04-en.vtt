00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.933
The Taíno

00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:02.366
left us with a rather exceptional

00:00:02.466 --> 00:00:03.266
material culture

00:00:03.533 --> 00:00:05.000
that remained unknown for a long time

00:00:05.133 --> 00:00:06.333
as it was overshadowed

00:00:06.466 --> 00:00:07.666
by other civilizations

00:00:08.266 --> 00:00:09.533
such as the Aztecs

00:00:09.733 --> 00:00:12.733
the Maya, or the Incas in Peru

00:00:13.133 --> 00:00:14.500
yet the Taíno

00:00:14.800 --> 00:00:17.300
left remarkable artifacts

00:00:17.566 --> 00:00:18.133
that are today

00:00:18.133 --> 00:00:19.800
preserved in various museums around the world

00:00:19.866 --> 00:00:20.800
or in the Caribbean

00:00:21.166 --> 00:00:22.900
which include

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:24.166
stone sculptures

00:00:24.166 --> 00:00:25.166
that have been well preserved

00:00:25.666 --> 00:00:26.566
in particular

00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:28.133
those we call "trigonoliths"

00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:29.600
or three-pointed stones that are

00:00:29.866 --> 00:00:31.266
very mysterious pieces but obviously

00:00:31.466 --> 00:00:33.533
have a whole religious or mythological symbolism

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:37.100
we also have stone-carved heads

00:00:37.533 --> 00:00:38.466
we also have

00:00:38.666 --> 00:00:40.166
beautiful wooden objects

00:00:40.266 --> 00:00:42.000
that have been preserved in caves

00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:43.200
statues

00:00:43.266 --> 00:00:45.533
vomiting spatulas

00:00:45.666 --> 00:00:46.866
used by shamans

00:00:46.966 --> 00:00:48.166
before inhaling drugs

00:00:48.366 --> 00:00:50.466
and then in some exceptional cases we have

00:00:50.666 --> 00:00:52.533
things made of organic materials

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:55.866
bone on one hand, sometimes manatee bone

00:00:56.166 --> 00:00:58.766
or some cotton artifacts

00:00:58.966 --> 00:01:02.066
made with plant or mineral materials

00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:04.266
like the cotton cemí from Turin

00:01:04.533 --> 00:01:06.266
or a cotton belt for example

00:01:06.366 --> 00:01:06.800
adorned with pearls

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:08.966
which is found in Austria
