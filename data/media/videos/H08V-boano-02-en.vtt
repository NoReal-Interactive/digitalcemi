00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:03.100
The analyses carried out so far on the cemí

00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:06.300
have been conducted with great care and precision

00:00:06.900 --> 00:00:07.966
using methods

00:00:08.200 --> 00:00:10.466
that respect the integrity of the artifact

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:14.266
in fact, the skull was studied

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:18.000
through X-rays and computerized tomography

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:19.100
which represents an evolution

00:00:19.100 --> 00:00:21.533
of radiographic techniques

00:00:21.533 --> 00:00:25.000
to assess the skull's preservation

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:28.666
and to identify basic anthropological traits

00:00:28.666 --> 00:00:31.000
thanks to this information, we now know that

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:33.500
inside the cemí

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:37.933
there is part of the skull of an adult male

00:00:37.933 --> 00:00:43.000
who presents clear cranial deformation of the frontal bone

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:46.266
likely the result of intentional action

00:00:46.533 --> 00:00:50.000
radiological studies also allowed us

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:53.300
to analyze the interior of the entire structure

00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:57.000
highlighting a highly complex

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:58.466
multi-material composition

00:00:58.533 --> 00:01:01.300
crafted from different materials

00:01:01.466 --> 00:01:04.800
with remarkable artisanal skill

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:07.733
finally, radiocarbon dating

00:01:07.733 --> 00:01:13.600
has placed the artifact in the pre-Columbian period

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:19.500
an aspect that has greatly increased its value
