00:00:00.600 --> 00:00:03.166
Despite the scientific analyses already conducted

00:00:03.466 --> 00:00:05.333
many questions remain unanswered

00:00:06.066 --> 00:00:08.966
especially about the individual to whom the skull belonged

00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:11.400
who was he? How did he live?

00:00:12.600 --> 00:00:13.733
where did he live?

00:00:14.100 --> 00:00:16.900
these are fascinating and intriguing questions

00:00:17.266 --> 00:00:20.466
that help make this story feel even more human

00:00:21.466 --> 00:00:22.700
and the answers

00:00:22.933 --> 00:00:23.866
to these questions

00:00:24.066 --> 00:00:26.866
could come from future scientific analyses

00:00:27.466 --> 00:00:28.266
in particular

00:00:28.366 --> 00:00:31.066
chemical analyses of the teeth and bones

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:34.966
could reveal interesting aspects—for example,

00:00:35.566 --> 00:00:39.000
about the individual’s diet or mobility

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:41.866
that is, whether he was born and lived

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.400
in the same place where he was found

00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:47.466
or whether he moved during his lifetime

00:00:48.266 --> 00:00:52.766
but DNA analysis could also reveal

00:00:53.066 --> 00:00:54.466
interesting findings

00:00:56.100 --> 00:01:00.333
especially about genetic relationships

00:01:00.666 --> 00:01:03.766
with Caribbean populations of that time

00:01:04.200 --> 00:01:05.500
as well as relationships

00:01:06.133 --> 00:01:08.300
with present-day Caribbean populations

00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:09.700
so analyses

00:01:09.933 --> 00:01:12.100
from a chronological point of view as well

00:01:12.266 --> 00:01:13.066
are very promising
