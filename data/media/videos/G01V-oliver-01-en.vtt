00:00:00.066 --> 00:00:03.300
Taíno is a word that

00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:05.500
today refers to a

00:00:05.866 --> 00:00:09.400
population that lived in the region between

00:00:09.400 --> 00:00:12.700
eastern Cuba, the Bahamas

00:00:13.566 --> 00:00:14.266
Puerto Rico

00:00:14.266 --> 00:00:17.333
Jamaica and up to the Virgin Islands

00:00:17.833 --> 00:00:18.266
however

00:00:18.266 --> 00:00:21.666
the term Taíno was not used in the early chronicles

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:26.300
it appears only two or three times in the chronicles

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:30.166
where the word Taíno means noble

00:00:30.666 --> 00:00:32.766
which is an interpretation by the Europeans

00:00:32.766 --> 00:00:34.600
of what that term meant

00:00:35.066 --> 00:00:38.100
but essentially 'we are good people'

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:39.966
'we are the good ones'

00:00:40.633 --> 00:00:42.133
and so Taíno

00:00:42.233 --> 00:00:46.200
is a word that is used very rarely until

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:47.233
archaeological

00:00:47.233 --> 00:00:49.866
and anthropological studies began to

00:00:49.966 --> 00:00:53.333
classify all these populations as Taíno

00:00:54.366 --> 00:00:56.133
however Taíno

00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:59.700
is not a homogeneous category

00:00:59.700 --> 00:01:01.566
it is not a single culture

00:01:01.833 --> 00:01:02.400
but rather

00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:05.733
there is a lot of variability among what one

00:01:06.166 --> 00:01:10.100
calls Taíno in terms of social organization

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:12.600
complexity and so on

00:01:13.033 --> 00:01:15.266
linguistically we know that

00:01:15.266 --> 00:01:17.300
there is a classical Taíno

00:01:17.466 --> 00:01:21.300
we call a classical Taíno mainly that of Hispaniola

00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:26.400
but there are also some dialects spoken elsewhere

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:28.700
for example in central Cuba

00:01:29.633 --> 00:01:34.366
and most likely in what we call the Lucayo Islands

00:01:34.366 --> 00:01:35.866
which today are the Bahamas

00:01:35.866 --> 00:01:37.900
or part of the Bahamas Islands

00:01:38.966 --> 00:01:42.233
in fact it is not a term that refers to an ethnonym

00:01:42.233 --> 00:01:44.700
it is not how they called themselves
