00:00:00.700 --> 00:00:05.666
The best example comes from the very first document

00:00:05.666 --> 00:00:08.133
ever written about Taino beliefs

00:00:08.266 --> 00:00:12.166
which was written very early in 1495–97

00:00:12.166 --> 00:00:14.400
it was produced

00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:17.166
at the request of Columbus himself

00:00:17.166 --> 00:00:20.266
who wanted to find out if the Taino had a religion

00:00:20.766 --> 00:00:22.666
in an institutional sense

00:00:22.666 --> 00:00:23.733
like we do

00:00:23.866 --> 00:00:26.300
and especially to find out if they had idolatry

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:27.100
the worship

00:00:27.566 --> 00:00:30.466
of false gods or false deities

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:34.666
so this guy was a hermit called

00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:40.466
Fray Ramon Pané, a Catalan

00:00:40.666 --> 00:00:44.400
he was sent to the center of Hispaniola

00:00:45.033 --> 00:00:46.366
to find all this out

00:00:46.366 --> 00:00:49.333
and he began to reside

00:00:49.833 --> 00:00:53.433
with the family of the main chief of the region

00:00:53.433 --> 00:00:59.600
called Guarionex and it is the elite version

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:00.800
of the Taino belief system

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:04.300
that he describes, in such a way

00:01:04.300 --> 00:01:06.433
that he did not try to

00:01:06.433 --> 00:01:08.766
over-interpret what they were trying to say

00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:12.266
as a writer his voice

00:01:12.466 --> 00:01:14.833
the first person singular

00:01:14.833 --> 00:01:19.100
does not appear until the end of this account

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:20.300
of this letter

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:23.500
or report he sent to Columbus

00:01:24.066 --> 00:01:29.233
that’s where you begin to see how

00:01:29.233 --> 00:01:31.066
first of all the cemí appears

00:01:31.866 --> 00:01:35.166
and what the relationship might have been between cemí

00:01:35.166 --> 00:01:38.866
and the chiefs, the caciques

00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:40.766
so basically

00:01:40.766 --> 00:01:41.600
Pané says

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:43.066
this is how they make them

00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:45.500
there’s a guy walking in the forest

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:48.666
a place he’s walked a thousand times

00:01:49.300 --> 00:01:54.800
but this time the tree had moved in a strange way

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:56.866
the light fell in a strange way

00:01:56.866 --> 00:02:01.100
it’s not normal, it’s an extraordinary circumstance

00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:05.866
and he thinks oh it might be imbued with cemí

00:02:06.033 --> 00:02:10.866
it’s not just a tree but a tree imbued

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:12.600
with this vital force

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:16.900
but he doesn’t have the skills to determine it

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:17.200
so

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:20.666
he goes back to the village and brings the shaman

00:02:22.066 --> 00:02:26.666
the shaman begins to converse with this cemí

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:30.500
but not before inhaling

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:33.066
the hallucinogen

00:02:33.066 --> 00:02:36.400
that the Taíno call cohoba

00:02:36.866 --> 00:02:39.600
which is Anadenanthera peregrina

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:41.166
and is a hallucinogen

00:02:41.166 --> 00:02:44.366
very powerful

00:02:44.466 --> 00:02:47.233
it gives you the effect of macroscopy

00:02:47.233 --> 00:02:49.400
meaning things appear overly magnified

00:02:49.566 --> 00:02:51.966
out-of-body experiences and, of course

00:02:51.966 --> 00:02:56.300
this is the medium through which the shaman can converse

00:02:56.766 --> 00:02:58.733
it's somewhat like a meta-language

00:02:59.166 --> 00:03:02.500
through what could be ecstatic dreams

00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:06.300
and there the cemí tells them its titles

00:03:06.566 --> 00:03:08.166
its names

00:03:09.166 --> 00:03:12.666
its specific powers

00:03:12.666 --> 00:03:14.766
the cemí did not have power over everything

00:03:14.766 --> 00:03:17.133
the things that were imbued with cemí

00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:19.633
could be related to rain

00:03:19.633 --> 00:03:22.400
hunting

00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:24.733
there were very specific powers

00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:29.766
for a chief to be truly powerful

00:03:29.766 --> 00:03:31.966
it meant having many cemí around him

00:03:31.966 --> 00:03:34.333
because each had different potentialities

00:03:34.700 --> 00:03:38.666
useful for a chief to execute

00:03:39.266 --> 00:03:41.600
his commands...

00:03:42.366 --> 00:03:44.166
but returning to the story

00:03:44.266 --> 00:03:46.066
this cemí was then

00:03:46.966 --> 00:03:47.766
taken

00:03:48.100 --> 00:03:49.966
to the village

00:03:49.966 --> 00:03:51.900
and the cemí orders them

00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:55.566
how its body should be represented

00:03:55.566 --> 00:03:58.200
in other words, how can I be sculpted

00:03:58.700 --> 00:04:00.600
as a bird or...

00:04:00.666 --> 00:04:02.566
what is my corporeal form

00:04:02.866 --> 00:04:04.200
once that happens

00:04:05.233 --> 00:04:06.733
this cemí then

00:04:06.800 --> 00:04:10.700
this object imbued with cemí arrives at the settlement

00:04:11.666 --> 00:04:14.000
and naturally the cemí would tell them

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:16.366
not only its titles, status, and everything else

00:04:16.366 --> 00:04:21.566
but also what kind of obligations it required

00:04:22.033 --> 00:04:25.133
the offering of the first harvest is an example

00:04:25.766 --> 00:04:27.333
they had to be fed

00:04:28.700 --> 00:04:31.233
naturally, the more elaborate the cemí

00:04:31.233 --> 00:04:32.200
that they guarded

00:04:33.200 --> 00:04:34.566
the more powerful

00:04:34.566 --> 00:04:38.533
were those that had a long list of titles

00:04:39.266 --> 00:04:41.700
it would be

00:04:41.700 --> 00:04:43.300
managed

00:04:43.600 --> 00:04:45.466
by the cacique

00:04:45.566 --> 00:04:48.600
the cacique was not the owner

00:04:48.966 --> 00:04:50.400
it was not property

00:04:51.066 --> 00:04:52.066
we also know

00:04:52.066 --> 00:04:55.266
thanks to one of the biographies of a cemí

00:04:55.266 --> 00:04:57.100
that that cemí escaped

00:04:58.900 --> 00:04:59.766
and it fled

00:04:59.766 --> 00:05:03.266
probably due to the incompetence of the chief

00:05:04.666 --> 00:05:07.100
so he had to return to retrieve it

00:05:07.166 --> 00:05:09.833
hunt it down, put it in a bag

00:05:09.833 --> 00:05:13.000
to bring it back to the settlement


00:05:13.633 --> 00:05:14.000
so

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:17.866
this means that chiefs could not command the cemí

00:05:18.700 --> 00:05:21.800
any more than the cemí could command the chiefs

00:05:22.400 --> 00:05:25.366
and it was this dual relationship

00:05:25.366 --> 00:05:28.166
that is at the heart of how government

00:05:28.300 --> 00:05:30.766
among the Taino took place

00:05:31.033 --> 00:05:33.100
the Taino chiefs

00:05:33.100 --> 00:05:37.133
the caciques could not govern wisely

00:05:37.633 --> 00:05:40.733
even if they descended from caciques

00:05:40.800 --> 00:05:43.166
from ancestral caciques

00:05:43.233 --> 00:05:47.900
their reputation was built on how much they could

00:05:48.400 --> 00:05:51.200
dialogue, negotiate with the cemí

00:05:51.566 --> 00:05:54.433
to make particular political decisions

00:05:54.433 --> 00:05:57.000
should we go hunting now

00:05:57.000 --> 00:05:58.166
should we go to war

00:05:58.500 --> 00:06:01.133
should I marry my daughter to this person

00:06:01.466 --> 00:06:02.800
and none of this could happen

00:06:02.800 --> 00:06:05.200
without consulting the cemí

00:06:05.400 --> 00:06:07.700
or with objects imbued with cemí

00:06:07.700 --> 00:06:10.733
that would then predict

00:06:13.200 --> 00:06:14.766
so this

00:06:14.800 --> 00:06:16.566
is the nexus

00:06:16.566 --> 00:06:17.700
of political power

00:06:17.700 --> 00:06:21.866
and all this takes place in a particular context

00:06:21.900 --> 00:06:24.333
which is what is called the cohoba ceremony

00:06:25.433 --> 00:06:26.200
because obviously

00:06:26.200 --> 00:06:30.300
to access in the best possible way

00:06:30.300 --> 00:06:31.466
you had to

00:06:32.100 --> 00:06:32.900
you know

00:06:33.433 --> 00:06:35.600
have an altered state of mind

00:06:35.600 --> 00:06:37.866
you had to take hallucinogenic drugs

00:06:37.866 --> 00:06:40.433
so that you could begin that meta dialogue

00:06:40.433 --> 00:06:44.300
that dreamlike dialogue with these objects that were

00:06:44.300 --> 00:06:47.300
in fact treated like persons
