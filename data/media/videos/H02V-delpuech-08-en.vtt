00:00:00.966 --> 00:00:01.966
The Taíno

00:00:02.133 --> 00:00:03.000
like most

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:04.766
of the peoples of the Amazon rainforest

00:00:04.866 --> 00:00:05.666
from which their ancestors

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:06.900
came

00:00:07.300 --> 00:00:08.700
regularly used

00:00:08.766 --> 00:00:11.266
hallucinogenic substances

00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:13.333
it was the shaman in particular

00:00:13.900 --> 00:00:15.166
a kind of priest and doctor

00:00:15.300 --> 00:00:17.266
who inhaled drugs to enter

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:18.400
an altered state of consciousness

00:00:18.666 --> 00:00:19.700
a kind of trance

00:00:19.900 --> 00:00:21.666
and contact spirits

00:00:21.766 --> 00:00:23.100
and higher powers

00:00:23.666 --> 00:00:25.266
to divine the future

00:00:25.533 --> 00:00:28.533
predict harvests, successes, and so on

00:00:28.933 --> 00:00:30.200
to do this the Taíno

00:00:30.466 --> 00:00:33.200
created an entire arsenal of objects

00:00:33.733 --> 00:00:35.766
statues with a tray on their head

00:00:36.066 --> 00:00:37.900
on which they placed the cohoba drug

00:00:38.333 --> 00:00:39.300
which is a plant we know

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:40.500
that was ground into powder

00:00:41.066 --> 00:00:42.766
they used spatulas to vomit

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:44.400
to purify themselves

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:45.966
by vomiting

00:00:46.333 --> 00:00:48.966
and then with the help of small Y-shaped objects

00:00:49.333 --> 00:00:50.500
that they placed in their nostrils

00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:53.500
they inhaled the cohoba

00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:55.600
to enter a trance

00:00:56.466 --> 00:00:59.133
and this cohoba ritual

00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:00.933
particularly impressed the Spaniards

00:01:01.266 --> 00:01:02.066
when they arrived

00:01:02.566 --> 00:01:04.133
it is thanks to this ritual that we have

00:01:04.466 --> 00:01:06.366
precise descriptions of these ceremonies

00:01:06.866 --> 00:01:08.300
that took place

00:01:08.566 --> 00:01:09.366
in a large house

00:01:09.466 --> 00:01:11.300
which was often the house of the leader

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:12.400
of the village

00:01:12.566 --> 00:01:13.400
the village chief

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:15.066
or inside a cavity

00:01:15.466 --> 00:01:16.866
moreover in these caves

00:01:16.900 --> 00:01:18.800
we find rock paintings

00:01:18.966 --> 00:01:21.133
that testify to these rituals

00:01:21.366 --> 00:01:22.766
linked to the underground world
