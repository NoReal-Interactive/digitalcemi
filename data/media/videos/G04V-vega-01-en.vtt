00:00:00.566 --> 00:00:01.800
It was a coincidence

00:00:02.966 --> 00:00:04.600
I was in London

00:00:04.900 --> 00:00:07.166
at the British Museum

00:00:07.766 --> 00:00:10.000
because I knew they had a good collection

00:00:10.866 --> 00:00:12.566
of wooden pieces

00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:14.333
of duho

00:00:15.466 --> 00:00:17.500
from Hispaniola

00:00:17.566 --> 00:00:19.666
but also from Jamaica and other places

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:22.600
and I wanted to take pictures of all of them

00:00:25.466 --> 00:00:27.400
with the possibility in mind

00:00:28.066 --> 00:00:30.366
of a temporary exhibition in Santo Domingo

00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:32.866
which I later realized as director of the Museo del Hombre

00:00:33.333 --> 00:00:34.500
and there I was surprised

00:00:35.133 --> 00:00:36.266
I saw this image

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:38.566
of the cotton cemí

00:00:39.866 --> 00:00:43.100
I asked the museum to send me

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:44.900
the photos

00:00:45.533 --> 00:00:46.766
so when I received them

00:00:47.366 --> 00:00:49.566
it was what interested me the most

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:50.800
they told me no

00:00:51.166 --> 00:00:53.500
it is not here and we do not know how it got here

00:00:55.066 --> 00:00:56.666
we simply have the photograph

00:00:57.266 --> 00:01:00.600
then I realized that Cambiaso

00:01:01.166 --> 00:01:01.966
was Italian

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:05.200
and had been the owner of the artifact

00:01:05.766 --> 00:01:08.266
then I asked for a list of institutions

00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:11.266
archaeological and museum

00:01:12.066 --> 00:01:14.266
in Italy, especially in the area

00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:17.900
where the Cambiaso family came from

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:21.400
and I wrote

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:22.500
wrote

00:01:22.866 --> 00:01:25.533
Until I found someone who knew that piece

00:01:25.666 --> 00:01:26.733
which was in Turin

00:01:27.333 --> 00:01:28.600
then I wrote to Turin

00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:29.600
there, for a long time

00:01:29.900 --> 00:01:32.700
they thought it was a Peruvian piece

00:01:32.866 --> 00:01:34.866
at some point

00:01:35.066 --> 00:01:37.133
they realized it was Caribbean

00:01:37.266 --> 00:01:38.466
but they did not give it importance

00:01:38.533 --> 00:01:39.800
until I finished my work

00:01:40.366 --> 00:01:43.200
in a way it was a coincidence

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:45.566
why was that photograph in London?

00:01:45.966 --> 00:01:48.933
if that photo had not been in London

00:01:49.166 --> 00:01:51.566
who knows if today we would know

00:01:52.300 --> 00:01:53.466
where this piece is
