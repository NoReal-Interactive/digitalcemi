00:00:00.266 --> 00:00:02.166
Since the first encounter between

00:00:02.533 --> 00:00:05.100
the Spaniards and the Amerindians of the Antilles

00:00:05.166 --> 00:00:05.900
of the Greater Antilles

00:00:05.900 --> 00:00:07.400
the Taíno

00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:08.066
the Europeans

00:00:08.066 --> 00:00:09.733
were fascinated by numerous objects

00:00:09.800 --> 00:00:11.466
of course there was gold

00:00:11.866 --> 00:00:13.800
but they brought to Spain

00:00:14.266 --> 00:00:16.000
many objects

00:00:16.300 --> 00:00:18.400
as proof of these exotic discoveries

00:00:18.533 --> 00:00:20.366
they also brought Amerindians

00:00:20.533 --> 00:00:21.600
in flesh and bone to show

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:23.266
the people they had encountered

00:00:23.933 --> 00:00:24.666
unfortunately

00:00:24.666 --> 00:00:27.066
these objects which were ornamental objects

00:00:27.133 --> 00:00:29.300
feather, cotton ornaments

00:00:29.566 --> 00:00:31.133
wooden sculptures

00:00:31.566 --> 00:00:33.333
were often very poorly preserved

00:00:33.466 --> 00:00:34.366
at the time

00:00:34.566 --> 00:00:36.466
there was no ethnographic interest

00:00:36.566 --> 00:00:38.733
often they were looking for gold on these artifacts

00:00:39.266 --> 00:00:40.133
and only a few

00:00:40.333 --> 00:00:41.366
very rare specimens

00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:43.266
from the period of the conquest have reached us

00:00:43.666 --> 00:00:44.900
they are found in Italy

00:00:45.266 --> 00:00:48.066
in the Vatican or in Austria

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:49.300
with the emperors

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:51.700
like Charles V

00:00:51.766 --> 00:00:53.900
who ruled both Spain

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:56.700
and Germany and part of Austria

00:00:56.866 --> 00:00:58.733
so we have very little from that period

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:01.566
everything else is the subject of archaeological discovery

00:01:01.766 --> 00:01:03.300
it is from the 19th century

00:01:03.366 --> 00:01:05.300
essentially the end of the 19th century

00:01:05.666 --> 00:01:07.800
that the first research will be carried out

00:01:07.966 --> 00:01:09.933
that we will discover strange objects

00:01:10.066 --> 00:01:11.800
and that we will start excavations

00:01:11.900 --> 00:01:12.500
archaeological

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:13.300
which have delivered to us

00:01:13.533 --> 00:01:15.333
a lot of information about these societies

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:16.800
until then unknown
