00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:02.300
On October 12, 1492

00:00:02.533 --> 00:00:03.600
is a date we remember

00:00:03.700 --> 00:00:04.533
in the history of humanity

00:00:04.600 --> 00:00:05.166
it is the day when

00:00:05.166 --> 00:00:07.200
Christopher Columbus and his famous three caravels

00:00:07.533 --> 00:00:08.500
landed on an island

00:00:08.766 --> 00:00:09.900
which today is located

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:11.466
in the present-day Bahamas

00:00:11.766 --> 00:00:13.733
and he believed he had reached the Indies

00:00:13.900 --> 00:00:14.700
and so

00:00:14.766 --> 00:00:16.066
he named the natives

00:00:16.200 --> 00:00:17.966
the people he met

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:19.533
the "Indians"

00:00:20.133 --> 00:00:21.866
and it was likely

00:00:22.100 --> 00:00:24.500
an encounter between aliens

00:00:24.766 --> 00:00:27.166
between the Spaniards emerging from the Middle Ages

00:00:27.266 --> 00:00:28.600
we are in 1492

00:00:28.866 --> 00:00:30.066
and these populations

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:31.500
that had existed for thousands of years

00:00:31.766 --> 00:00:33.166
and had never spoken to each other

00:00:33.333 --> 00:00:34.000
never met

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:36.066
who did not even know each other

00:00:36.566 --> 00:00:39.366
this encounter was initially peaceful

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:41.666
it was a journey of discovery

00:00:41.766 --> 00:00:43.700
the first voyage of 1492

00:00:44.066 --> 00:00:46.866
which very soon gave way to colonization

00:00:47.066 --> 00:00:49.500
to conquest and its share of violence

00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:51.333
starting with slavery

00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:53.066
or the obligation for the Taíno

00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:54.500
to work in the gold mines

00:00:54.900 --> 00:00:57.666
diseases decimated the population

00:00:58.166 --> 00:00:58.800
and the revolts that

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:00.533
led first to war

00:01:00.700 --> 00:01:02.733
and then to a true genocide

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:04.700
the Taíno civilization

00:01:04.966 --> 00:01:07.100
collapsed rapidly

00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:09.000
only a few survivors remained

00:01:09.266 --> 00:01:10.300
more or less mixed-race

00:01:10.533 --> 00:01:12.766
who have continued to this day
