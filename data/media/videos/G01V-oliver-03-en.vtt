00:00:00.266 --> 00:00:02.766
The best way to describe it is that they had

00:00:02.766 --> 00:00:05.766
a well-balanced mixed economy

00:00:05.766 --> 00:00:06.900
they were

00:00:06.900 --> 00:00:10.533
a population of farmers

00:00:10.900 --> 00:00:15.133
they had gardens, domestic gardens

00:00:15.166 --> 00:00:17.166
where they grew essential things

00:00:17.166 --> 00:00:21.066
and where they experimented with new types of plants

00:00:21.066 --> 00:00:23.166
to see if they would reproduce

00:00:23.966 --> 00:00:28.566
they also had what they call "conuco"

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:32.800
conuco is the Swidden field, slash and burn

00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:37.766
it is a larger garden where they grew plants

00:00:38.633 --> 00:00:43.933
things like cassava, the most important carbohydrates

00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:45.266
sweet potatoes

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:46.933
corn

00:00:48.033 --> 00:00:50.466
a whole range of products

00:00:50.466 --> 00:00:52.133
some of them domesticated

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:55.366
others were put under management

00:00:56.466 --> 00:01:00.800
particularly fruit trees that were part

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:03.533
of the cultivation fields

00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:08.300
and proteins were essentially extracted

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:09.966
from fishing

00:01:09.966 --> 00:01:12.133
from sea fishing

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:15.600
the rivers do not have many fish

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:17.100
not comparable

00:01:17.266 --> 00:01:21.300
to the range and variety you can get from the oceans

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:22.800
and we have some evidence

00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:24.366
that these were actually transported

00:01:24.366 --> 00:01:26.266
up to the mountain regions

00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:29.600
they were probably salted or smoked

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:31.766
so that they could last longer

00:01:31.766 --> 00:01:33.800
and reach areas that were

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:35.800
a bit further from the coast

00:01:36.366 --> 00:01:39.266
the Caribbean is well known as

00:01:39.266 --> 00:01:41.000
most islands in the world

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:43.566
for having very poor mammal fauna

00:01:44.633 --> 00:01:46.833
so of the terrestrial animals

00:01:46.833 --> 00:01:50.000
among the most important mammals

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:51.566
was the hutia

00:01:51.566 --> 00:01:52.900
which is a Taíno term

00:01:52.900 --> 00:01:56.466
for a type of rodent

00:01:56.466 --> 00:01:58.800
that has almost become extinct

00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:00.600
and nowadays

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:04.566
you can only find them in some isolated parts

00:02:04.566 --> 00:02:05.466
of Hispaniola

00:02:06.033 --> 00:02:09.366
it is absent in Puerto Rico or the Virgin Islands

00:02:09.400 --> 00:02:13.100
and Cuba still has a population

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:14.500
we don't know how large

00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:17.700
it was obviously overhunted

00:02:18.766 --> 00:02:20.600
probably

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:23.766
the population increased when the Spaniards began to arrive

00:02:23.766 --> 00:02:26.900
and immigration started

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:31.400
they had a very varied diet
