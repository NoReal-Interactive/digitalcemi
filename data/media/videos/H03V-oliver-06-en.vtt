00:00:00.033 --> 00:00:06.400
The best way to describe the meaning of cemí is

00:00:07.066 --> 00:00:08.666
a supernatural force

00:00:09.633 --> 00:00:15.366
it is a vital force that animates objects

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:19.166
so it falls within the realm of animism

00:00:19.166 --> 00:00:21.066
societies that are animistic

00:00:21.666 --> 00:00:24.000
that give their objects

00:00:24.233 --> 00:00:27.166
a vital force that makes them agents

00:00:27.833 --> 00:00:30.200
not just

00:00:31.966 --> 00:00:34.166
containers

00:00:34.166 --> 00:00:38.133
but with the power to interact with

00:00:38.266 --> 00:00:41.500
in social terms, with living populations

00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:43.800
and as such

00:00:43.966 --> 00:00:47.666
objects that are imbued with cemí

00:00:49.033 --> 00:00:52.533
are essentially beings

00:00:53.366 --> 00:00:55.666
maybe not human beings like us

00:00:55.666 --> 00:00:57.133
but they are beings

00:00:58.200 --> 00:01:00.733
and it doesn't matter if they are made of stone

00:01:00.833 --> 00:01:03.266
or rocks or potery

00:01:03.266 --> 00:01:04.933
or some other material

00:01:05.266 --> 00:01:08.700
as long as they have that vital force

00:01:09.966 --> 00:01:11.500
that permeates

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:17.900
the matter that composes them and that they are treated as

00:01:18.033 --> 00:01:19.566
powerful objects

00:01:20.666 --> 00:01:23.366
and so we have a whole range

00:01:23.366 --> 00:01:26.166
of very beautiful pots that can have...

00:01:26.266 --> 00:01:29.933
but not all things were cemí or imbued with cemí
