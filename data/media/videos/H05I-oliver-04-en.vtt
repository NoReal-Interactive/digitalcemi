00:00:00.033 --> 00:00:03.466
The word cacique that the Spaniards associated

00:00:03.466 --> 00:00:06.733
with European kings

00:00:07.266 --> 00:00:08.066
with princes

00:00:08.800 --> 00:00:09.900
lords

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:11.866
high-ranking people comparing them with

00:00:11.866 --> 00:00:14.666
the structures of medieval Spain

00:00:14.666 --> 00:00:16.766
or Renaissance Spain

00:00:17.366 --> 00:00:21.966
but cacique is a word that still survives

00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:25.066
in an Arawakan language still spoken

00:00:25.066 --> 00:00:27.466
spoken in Guyana

00:00:30.166 --> 00:00:34.200
which is translated and obviously is not Taino

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:36.766
in this group we call Lokono

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:41.366
or Lukunu from Guyana which is

00:00:41.366 --> 00:00:43.666
a native population that survives there

00:00:43.833 --> 00:00:50.500
and the term is composed of a K and cique

00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:53.166
or sikwa and this means 'house'

00:00:54.366 --> 00:00:59.033
so cacique is 'the one who rules the house'

00:00:59.033 --> 00:01:02.100
the person who

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:04.066
commands the house

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:06.366
is the highest

00:01:06.366 --> 00:01:11.300
the head of the family

00:01:11.566 --> 00:01:13.900
both male and female

00:01:13.900 --> 00:01:16.066
because in this

00:01:16.366 --> 00:01:18.500
language of Guyana, Arawak

00:01:18.866 --> 00:01:21.100
they have suffixes that indicate

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:22.933
whether it is a man or a woman

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:26.600
so it is kasikwali kasikwari

00:01:28.766 --> 00:01:31.433
you can see that the word cacique

00:01:31.433 --> 00:01:33.900
as it was transcribed

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:37.133
by the Spaniards in the Caribbean

00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:39.500
is a related word

00:01:39.633 --> 00:01:43.366
it has the same meaning of being the responsible

00:01:43.366 --> 00:01:46.733
the person who governs the house

00:01:47.666 --> 00:01:48.666
obviously

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:53.400
the people of Guyana are not a very hierarchical society

00:01:53.400 --> 00:01:56.066
today they are much more egalitarian

00:01:56.433 --> 00:01:58.066
there is some inequality

00:01:58.300 --> 00:02:00.400
but there are no

00:02:01.066 --> 00:02:03.800
great caciques like those described by the Spaniards

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:04.900
on the islands

00:02:04.900 --> 00:02:10.466
so it seems that the meaning of the term was

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:14.300
dedicated to individuals of higher rank

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:18.033
in the Caribbean and note that the word 'house'

00:02:18.033 --> 00:02:21.366
just like in Europe the house of Habsburg

00:02:22.633 --> 00:02:26.233
so it may well be that even in the Caribbean

00:02:26.233 --> 00:02:30.366
it does not refer to the physical house, that this person

00:02:30.366 --> 00:02:31.500
governs

00:02:32.233 --> 00:02:34.366
but the house in a broader sense

00:02:34.366 --> 00:02:37.666
as in the Levi-Straussian sense, broader

00:02:38.466 --> 00:02:39.433
that involves you know

00:02:39.433 --> 00:02:40.433
all the kin

00:02:40.433 --> 00:02:43.000
and the people who are attached to that house
