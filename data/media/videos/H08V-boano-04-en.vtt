00:00:00.733 --> 00:00:02.800
Each analysis that is carried out

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:05.300
is a small step toward reconstructing

00:00:05.500 --> 00:00:07.533
the osteobiography of the individual

00:00:07.900 --> 00:00:09.700
and the biography of the artifact

00:00:10.600 --> 00:00:12.266
studying and highlighting

00:00:12.600 --> 00:00:15.200
ancient human remains in a museum context

00:00:15.700 --> 00:00:17.133
is a very important step

00:00:17.766 --> 00:00:20.366
but a very delicate one from an ethical perspective

00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:23.066
and a careful balance is needed

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:25.133
between the desire to know

00:00:25.533 --> 00:00:28.900
and the need to preserve remains so important

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:31.600
to our shared human history
