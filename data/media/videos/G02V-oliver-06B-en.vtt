00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:03.000
Another really important object

00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:05.966
that is not really related to cemí

00:00:05.966 --> 00:00:10.933
is the waisiba or what the Spaniards call guaíza

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:11.866
guaíza

00:00:12.633 --> 00:00:14.666
which has two translations

00:00:14.666 --> 00:00:17.666
one means beak or face

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:21.766
and the other means 'the soul of the living'

00:00:24.366 --> 00:00:26.766
and these objects were indeed

00:00:26.766 --> 00:00:29.833
involved in the first diplomatic relations

00:00:29.833 --> 00:00:31.466
that Columbus had

00:00:31.566 --> 00:00:34.766
with the indigenous populations of northern Hispaniola

00:00:35.833 --> 00:00:38.633
and what is really important is that

00:00:38.633 --> 00:00:41.633
of course they were carved

00:00:41.633 --> 00:00:45.400
they were made of cotton with a rigid support

00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:47.766
which could be shell or wood

00:00:48.466 --> 00:00:51.066
naturally they were adorned with

00:00:51.066 --> 00:00:53.466
precious stones or gold

00:00:53.466 --> 00:00:56.333
and this is what attracted the Spaniards

00:00:56.666 --> 00:00:59.066
and what is interesting is that

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:03.133
when a cacique takes his guaíza

00:01:03.266 --> 00:01:05.700
which is his face and his soul

00:01:06.233 --> 00:01:09.400
and gives it to Columbus

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:13.733
it means "I am giving

00:01:14.266 --> 00:01:17.700
my soul and my face to you

00:01:19.433 --> 00:01:23.666
and from now on I will be you and you will be me"

00:01:23.900 --> 00:01:27.500
and so that particular chief became

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:30.200
Christopher

00:01:30.833 --> 00:01:32.766
and from their perspective

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:35.866
Columbus became Wakanagari

00:01:35.866 --> 00:01:39.100
who was the chief who made that offer

00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:46.433
They also offered them women

00:01:46.433 --> 00:01:48.166
in marriage

00:01:49.866 --> 00:01:52.466
so you can see how they are beginning to establish

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:54.400
relationships

00:01:54.400 --> 00:01:57.166
indestructible relationships because from now on

00:01:57.166 --> 00:01:59.900
you are me and I am you I cannot betray you

00:02:01.766 --> 00:02:04.166
and this implies this particular object

00:02:04.166 --> 00:02:05.200
that were found

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:08.066
unfortunately not in cotton or wood

00:02:08.233 --> 00:02:09.700
but of shell

00:02:10.366 --> 00:02:13.100
some of them are in the form of figurines

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:18.466
tied on the arms, these guaíza, these faces

00:02:18.833 --> 00:02:20.233
and the Spaniards described

00:02:20.233 --> 00:02:23.666
people wearing them on their faces

00:02:24.566 --> 00:02:26.266
or on their belts

00:02:26.633 --> 00:02:29.366
so it is a very important concept

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:34.500
to understand the political alliances between different groups
