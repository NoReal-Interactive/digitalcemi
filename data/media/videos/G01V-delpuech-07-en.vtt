00:00:00.900 --> 00:00:03.600
The Taíno and their neighbors

00:00:03.766 --> 00:00:04.933
of the Antilles

00:00:04.933 --> 00:00:06.133
At the same time as the Taíno

00:00:06.166 --> 00:00:06.900
in the Greater Antilles

00:00:06.900 --> 00:00:07.766
we find

00:00:07.933 --> 00:00:10.066
human groups called Kalinago

00:00:10.166 --> 00:00:11.266
in the Lesser Antilles

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:12.866
These peoples had a past

00:00:13.300 --> 00:00:14.500
spanning several millennia

00:00:14.666 --> 00:00:16.800
Thus, this long history of the Caribbean

00:00:16.933 --> 00:00:17.900
before the arrival of Europeans

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.766
is gradually revealed by archaeologists

00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:23.500
and we become aware of how that space

00:00:23.500 --> 00:00:24.333
was very different

00:00:24.366 --> 00:00:25.466
from what it is today

00:00:25.566 --> 00:00:27.333
as it was populated by great sailors

00:00:27.533 --> 00:00:30.100
who navigated the Caribbean space from island to island

00:00:30.133 --> 00:00:31.866
constantly connecting to the continent

00:00:32.266 --> 00:00:33.933
particularly to the coasts of Venezuela

00:00:34.266 --> 00:00:35.733
and I think it is important

00:00:35.733 --> 00:00:36.533
for Caribbean people

00:00:36.566 --> 00:00:37.766
to become aware of this unity

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:39.066
of the Caribbean Sea

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:41.366
which was fragmented by colonization

00:00:41.466 --> 00:00:43.000
We have an island that speaks English

00:00:43.266 --> 00:00:45.666
an island that speaks Spanish, another French

00:00:46.066 --> 00:00:47.000
and often

00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:49.333
they remained in relation with the colonial metropolises

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:50.700
but speak little to each other

00:00:50.933 --> 00:00:52.333
Today there is a trend

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:53.600
especially among the younger generations

00:00:53.666 --> 00:00:56.100
to reclaim this Caribbean unity

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:57.066
and to consider that

00:00:57.100 --> 00:00:58.400
they share the same history

00:00:58.933 --> 00:01:00.366
in colonial history

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:02.366
despite different protections

00:01:02.466 --> 00:01:03.766
kingdoms that were not the same

00:01:03.966 --> 00:01:06.266
all suffered slavery

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:09.133
the impact of sugar plantations

00:01:09.333 --> 00:01:10.200
coffee

00:01:10.666 --> 00:01:11.466
today

00:01:11.733 --> 00:01:12.533
despite everything

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:14.366
they seek to constitute a cultural unity

00:01:14.466 --> 00:01:15.466
in the Caribbean

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:17.966
only language is still a barrier

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.000
but it is gradually falling
